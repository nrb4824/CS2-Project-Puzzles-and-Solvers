# CS2-Project-Puzzles-and-Solvers
This was a CS2 project I worked on in a team of 2. My partner and I worked on a joint solver that could work for numerous puzzles to find the solution.
Once created we each chose a larger puzzle type to create in Java. I worked on Hoppers. I created a working ptui, gui, model, and solver caller that worked with 
the existing solver. My Hopper game allowed the user to play it, or have it solved.
